# advent_2020

My attempt at Advent of Code - 2020.

Please note that day_01 was my first ever Rust program, so please look at my attempts further in the challenge to get a greater feel for my capability. One good example is day_18, where I implemented an algorithm to parse from infix notation to RPN, and then evaluated arithmetic expressions with a non-standard operator precedence.

Thanks go to Eric Wastl. Please see the challenge here:
